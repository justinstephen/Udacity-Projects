  <h1>How a baseball player's size affects home runs</h1>
  <p>
    For this project I decided to use a dataset of baseball players that includes the players' weight, height, handedness, and home run totals. I thought it would be interesting to look at the effect a player's size had on the amount of home runs that player
    hit. The weight is indicated in pounds while the height is measured in inches.
  </p>
  <h3>Weight and Home Runs</h3>
  <p>This first section is the players' weight plotted out against their home run totals. My initial hunch had been that the heavier the player, the more home runs that player would hit. Looking at the chart bellow it looks like there is definitely a relationship
    between the two. While most of the lighter players only hit about 40 to 50 home runs over their career, the players weighing over 190 pounds hit roughly 80 home runs on average.</p>
  <div id="weightChart"> </div>
  <h3>Height and Home Runs</h3>
  <p>I decided to explore height next, but it also seemed to not have a direct effect on the amount of home runs hit by a player. Both the shorter and taller players hit fewer home runs, while those with an above average height hit the most home runs
    on average.</p>
