  <h1>How a baseball player's size affects home runs</h1>
  <p>
    For this project I decided to use a dataset of baseball players that includes the players' weight, height, handedness, and home run totals. I thought it would be interesting to look at the effect a player's size had on the amount of home runs that player
    hit. The points are color coded based on the handedness of the player; right, left, or both (switch hitter). The weight is indicated in pounds while the height is measured in inches.
  </p>
  <h3>Weight and Home Runs</h3>
  <p>This first section is the players' weight plotted out against their home run totals. Where I had initially thought that a players weight would have a large impact on the amount of home runs a player hit, there appears to be only a very very small correlation,
    if any at all.</p>
  <div id="weightChart"> </div>
  <h3>Height and Home Runs</h3>
  <p>I decided to explore height next, but it also seemed to have very little effect on the amount of home runs hit by a player.</p>
  <div id="heightChart"></div>
  <h3>Average and Home Runs</h3>
  <p>As an added bonus I decided to explore if a baseball players average had any correlation to their home run totals. It appears there is a small amout of correlation, although it is important to note that batting average is a rate stat while home runs are a counting stat.
         Because of this, a player who played very little may have an extremely high average with a low home run total.</p>
