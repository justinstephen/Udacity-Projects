  <h1>Baseball player's size effects on home runs</h1>
  <p>
    For this project I decided to use a dataset of baseball players that includes the players' weight, height, handedness, and home run totals. I thought it would be interesting to look at the effect a player's size had on the amount of home runs that player
    hit.
  </p>
  <h3>Weight and Home Runs</h3>
  <p>This first section is the players' weight plotted out against their home run totals. Where I had initially thought that a players weight would have a large impact on the amount of home runs a player hit, there appears to be only a very very small correlation,
    if any at all.</p>
  <div id="weightChart">
    <script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js"></script>
    <script src="http://dimplejs.org/dist/dimple.v2.1.6.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var w_svg = dimple.newSvg("#weightChart", 590, 400);
      d3.csv("baseball_data.csv", function(data) {
        var myChart = new dimple.chart(w_svg, data);
        myChart.setBounds(60, 30, 500, 330);
        myChart.addMeasureAxis("x", "weight")
        myChart.addMeasureAxis("y", "HR");
        myChart.addSeries(["name", "handedness"], dimple.plot.bubble);
        myChart.addLegend(200, 10, 360, 20, "right");
        myChart.draw();
      });
    </script>
  </div>
  <h3>Height and Home Runs</h3>
  <p>I decided to explore height next, but it seemed to have even less of an effect on a players home run totals.</p>
  <div id="heightChart">
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var h_svg = dimple.newSvg("#heightChart", 590, 400);
      d3.csv("baseball_data.csv", function(data) {
        var myChart = new dimple.chart(h_svg, data);
        myChart.setBounds(60, 30, 500, 330);
        myChart.addMeasureAxis("x", "height");
        myChart.addMeasureAxis("y", "HR");
        myChart.addSeries(["name", "handedness"], dimple.plot.bubble);
        myChart.addLegend(200, 10, 360, 20, "right");
        myChart.draw();
      });
    </script>
  </div>
